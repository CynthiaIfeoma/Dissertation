This is the code used for the analysis used in my masters thesis 'State Responses to Terrorism' at the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge. The research aimed to analyse the effects of state responses to the development trajectory of the Balochistan Liberation Army in Pakistan, and Boko Haram in Nigeria, focusing on the initial interactions.
The R programming language was used for the analysis.
